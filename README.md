# Project Title:
## Using the Support Vector Mechanism algorithm of supervised Machine Learning, predict iris.csv dataset to find out the species is same or different. 
# Project Statement:
## A american based botnical garden a grow iris flower in their labs but using Bio-Technology in a single tree different type of varity flower is grow as a data science engineer find out how much accuracy is their all categories contain same species.
# Task-1
## Preprocess the data in skit.learn library.
# Tast-2:
## Load the data using Sklearn model selection default argument
# Task-3:
## On the basis of your datasets or data train,test and split SVM model
# Task-4:
## Implement Support Vector Mechanism Classifier using svm_classifier.The SVM must be "Linear"
# Task-5:
## Train the classifier on the training data
# Task-6:
## Find out the prediciton value on the test data
# Task-7:
## Test the model with the help of accuracy, accuracy should be lie in the range 0 to 1.

# Conclusion:
## According to my Support Vector Mechanism model the species are "Linear".With the accuracy of 1.00.
## Hence proved model was successfully implement.
